## Application structure

Application is built using [Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) and [Apollo GraphQL Server](https://www.apollographql.com/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

App is deployed to [Vercel cloud service](https://vercel.com/) via [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sakkelaaksonen/assignment2)

### Routes

- `/pages/api/graphql.js` GraphQL API entry point.

  Responds to `/api/graphql`

- `/pages/index.js` Index view. Lists all stations returned from API via GraphQL.

  Responds to `/(index.js)`

- `/pages/stations/[id].js` Single station view. Accessible directly or via browsing the index.

  Responds to `/stations/[id]`

### GraphQL

- `/pages/api/queries/index.js` contains GraphQL queries for station list and single station by ID

- `/pages/api/schemas/index.js` contains GraphQL schemas for given API endpoints

- `/pages/api/resolvers/index.js` contains GraphQL resolvers for given API endpoints

## Known caveats

- Because React hooks hide away asynchronity of useRoute and useQuery do not resolve as expected. This leads to missing router parameters in graphql queries and other temporal and scopic oddities.

## Production preparation and scability notes

- Add tests

- Add internationalization

- Add style preprocessor if required (stylus is my personal preference but anything goes)

- Check accessibility requirements

- Thorough assessment of meta content in views

- Analytics if required

- Convert images to svg for both development purposes and UX/UI scalability and payload optimization.

- React PropTypes

- TypeScript support

- PropTypes to TypeScript
